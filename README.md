# CountESS MiniMap2 Plugin

This is a plugin to allow [MiniMap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) 
to be used from within [CountESS](https://github.com/CountESS-Project/CountESS/)

This might be useful, but it also stands as a handy example of how to write
a CountESS plugin which wraps an external Python library.
